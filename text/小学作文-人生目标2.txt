Whether that is in the field of business, technology, or something else entirely, I want to be doing something that I am proud of and that makes me excited to wake up and go to work every day. In terms of my personal life, my goal is to surround myself with people who support and inspire me. I want to have a strong and loving family, as well as close friends who I can rely on and who share my values and interests. I also want to be a good partner and parent, and to have a happy and healthy relationship.
